        <p id="title">Nara Park, also known as the Deer Park or Nara Kōen, is located in the city of Nara, Japan. <br></br></p>

<p>Focusing on the deers, they are considered as the divine and sacred ones in Japan. Killing the deers will result in a death penalty back in the 1637, and that was the last breach of law that was recorded. As more tourist came to visit the Nara Park, the more injuries of deer has been reported. Therefore it is good to see that it became a popular attraction for tourists, but the injuries of the deers are also unfortunate to be seen.</p>
