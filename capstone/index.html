    <!-- first question-->
    <div class="subhead">
      <h2>Who are you as a designer? </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="response">

      <p> I consider myself as a <mark><span>graphic designer</span></mark>, and a part-time <mark><span>human center
            design thinker</mark></span>. Since I was little, I have always imagined myself growing bigger and getting
        more professional at creating visuals that convey more than just than a good appearance to the viewers. I am
        always looking forward to applying new skills on top of what I already know to enhance the outcome of the visual
        I am creating. </p>
    </div>
    <!--second one-->
    <div class="subhead">
      <h2>What is the most important thing you want people to take away from viewing your portfolio?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="response">

      <p> One most important thing that I want people to take away from viewing my portfolio is that <mark><span>I am
            capable of creating multiple aspects of designs, such as graphic design, web design, art(drawing) design,
            and much more!</mark></span> I want people to know that I can be an all-rounder, and I can be good at a
        specific category as well.</p>
    </div>
    <!--third-->
    <div class="subhead">
      <h2>What are your three strongest skills?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="response">

      <p> My two out of three of my strongest skills are <mark><span>using photoshop/illustrator to create graphic art,
            and editing portraits to sharpen up the person in the shot and edit the colors and style to display a
            certain atmosphere. </mark></span>Photoshop is a tool that I have been in touch with since my elementary
        years, and throughout the years I have been creating graphics for celebrity forums from China. Although I did
        not discover Illustrator until my high school years, but I am still striving to learn new skills to improve
        myself when it comes to creating on Illustrator. I have not discovered my third one yet, but I am hoping that it
        will be web development coding.</p>
    </div>
    <!--fourth-->
    <div class="subhead">
      <h2>What are you using for inspiration?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="response">

      <p> Sources I use to find my inspiration: <mark><span>other peopleâ€™s work that they post on Dribbble, DeviantArt,
            Bestfolios, Awwwards, etc. I follow a certain group of users from those websites in order to gain insights
            on different design styles, in order to improve my own.</mark></span> I tend to follow ones that I feel
        connected to, such as the way that they use colors and fonts, etc. When it comes to Dribbble, I focus more on
        the web and mobile app interface designs, whereas I use DeviantArt to look for graphic design inspirations.
        Awwwards and Bestfolios are used to understand current design trends and great examples to inspire my own
        portfolio.</p>
